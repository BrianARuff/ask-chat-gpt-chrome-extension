🚀 Hey everyone! Thrilled to unveil a handy tool I crafted in my free time 🚀

I noticed that I was frequently copying text from web pages to Chat GPT and thought there must be a more seamless way to do this. So, I whipped up a simple Chrome extension that lets you highlight text and directly send it to Chat GPT's input field, bypassing the copy-paste dance.

What made this project even more enjoyable was using Remotion. It's an innovative library that transforms React code into videos, essentially turning your code into a dynamic video editor. It made crafting a video guide for the extension a breeze!

I hope you find this small tool handy and enjoy the convenience it brings to your Chat GPT experience! Have you ever created something to solve a small annoyance in your daily workflow? Let me know your thoughts. 😊

**⚠️ Warning**

> You may encounter a message from Chat GPT stating, "Our systems have detected unusual activity from your system. Please try again later." or a similar alert. As of November 2, 2023, I have received this message approximately 10 times and continue to use my paid premium Chat-GPT account without issues. I **believe** this message is a precaution to ensure users are not bots, and clicking "try again" should resolve the issue. In my experience, it has always worked fine. While I don't anticipate OpenAI taking action against user accounts for this reason, I find it ethically important to inform you about the possibility of encountering this warning. Below is a screenshot of the warning message for reference.

This application is designed with user privacy in mind and does not collect or store any personal information. Once your text is processed by Chat-GPT, it is promptly removed from any temporary storage. Furthermore, we have taken steps to ensure that the app aligns with Chat-GPT's terms of service.
