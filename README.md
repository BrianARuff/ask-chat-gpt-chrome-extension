🚀 Hey everyone! Thrilled to unveil a handy tool I crafted in my free time 🚀

I noticed that I was frequently copying text from web pages to Chat GPT and thought there must be a more seamless way to do this. So, I whipped up a simple Chrome extension that lets you highlight text and directly send it to Chat GPT's input field, bypassing the copy-paste dance.

What made this project even more enjoyable was using Remotion. It's an innovative library that transforms React code into videos, essentially turning your code into a dynamic video editor. It made crafting a video guide for the extension a breeze!

I hope you find this small tool handy and enjoy the convenience it brings to your Chat GPT experience! Have you ever created something to solve a small annoyance in your daily workflow? Let me know your thoughts. 😊
